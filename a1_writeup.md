# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?

I think Python is very unique for many different reasons. It is very simple, almost like English when your programming. I learned Java last year and usually use JavaScript, so something like Python is definitely a change to get used to. Also sometimes it just feels wrong for me to not put semicolons at the end of every line.


2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?

Some similarities are that you can import modules in Python along with many other programming languages, which is useful as it lets you use other peoples code. Also, python has all of the basic functions that many other languages have as well, like taking user input (scanner in java) or 'for' loops, if statements, etc. Some differences are the operators, which in Python are more english based (and, or) vs other programming languages like JavaScript (||, &&). Overall, I think that Python is more geared towards beginners than other languages. 


3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?

Throughout this assignment, I learned how to complete basic standard programs dealing with arrays and math functions in Python. I used this assignment to convert my programming skills in other langauges to Python, using the Python syntax. Also, I very slightly familiarized myself with some Python modules that could be useful in the future. Overall, this assignment was a very good introduction to Python.
